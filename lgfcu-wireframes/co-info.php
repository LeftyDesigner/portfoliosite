			<h2>LGFCU Company Information</h2>
			
<h3>Our mission</h3>
<p>
To improve the lives of our members
</p>

<h3>Our vision</h3>
<p>
To promote thrift among members by affording them an opportunity to accumulate their savings and to create for them a source of credit for provident or productive purposes. By improving members' lives, LGFCU believes the communities in which they live across the state of North Carolina will also become better places to live, work and play.
Our values

Local Government Federal Credit Union is committed to distinctive quality and unparalleled member service in all aspects of our business. Driving everything we do is a set of powerful ideas that make up the credit union philosophy. These ideas are enduring. They've worked successfully, virtually unchanged, for a more than a century. They're also universal, effective in all kinds of communities, and in different types of political and economic systems in countries all over the world.

Yet, the ideas that form the core of our philosophy are also simple. They're all based on one strong belief: People are more important than dollars.
</p>

<h3>Benefits</h3>
<p>
Employees receive competitive benefits that include 401(k) retirement, major medical, dental, vision, short and long term disability, life insurance, flex spending account for medical and childcare, supplemental life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment insurance, paid holidays, vacation, sick leave, paid volunteer time, professional development, tuition reimbursement and a variety of financial services including free financial counseling and planning.
</p>

<h3>Diversity</h3>
<p>
LGFCU recognizes the value of demographic diversity in staff, volunteers and members, and strives to bring people of diverse backgrounds and experiences into leadership and other roles at the credit union. However, demographic factors are not brought into consideration on LGFCU-related issues or decisions; all of these actions are based on merit alone—diversity naturally follows suit.
