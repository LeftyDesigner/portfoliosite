				*APR means Annual Percentage Rate. The 1.99% promo/intro rate applies to balance transfers only. All other existing balances will remain at the current rate of 9.75%. Offer applies only to balances transferred from other financial institutions and does not apply to cash advances. LGFCU is offering a promotional/intro rate on balance transfers from now through January 31, 2014. The promotional/intro rate is in effect for 12 months from the date of the balance transfer. After the promotional/intro period expires, the APR will revert to the purchase rate, currently 9.75%.
